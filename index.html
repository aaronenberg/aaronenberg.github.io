            </p>
                Hi, my name is Aaron. I am a senior at Sac State pursuing 
                my bachelor's of Science in computer science. My interests 
                include machine learning, the linux kernel, and Linux container 
                runtimes (e.g. Docker) and container orchestrators (e.g. Kubernetes).
            <p>
                One of my goals is to learn C systems programming and the many subsystems that
                make up the linux kernel<br>
                well enough to be able to contribute to its open-source codebase.
            </p>
            <h3>Programming Languages I've used</h3>

                <th>Experienced</th>
                <th>Keen to learn</th>

                <td>Python</td>
                <td>C</td>

              <tr>
                <td>Java</td>
                <td>Bash</td>

                    <li>
                        (a) Syntax
                            - A set of rules that defines the combination of symbols that are
                            considered to be a correctly structured document or fragment 
                            in a language (Wikipedia).
                            - The aspects of a programming language that can be modeled by a
                            context-free grammer (Linz).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (b) Semantics
                            - The rules of a programming language that determine how the meaning
                            of a particualar construct is interpreted (Linz).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (c) Lexical Scanning
                        - The process of converting a sequence of characters into a sequence of 
                        tokens, or strings with certain semantic meaning (Wikipedia).
                            
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (d) Parsing and Parser
                            - Parsing, or syntax analysis, is a way of describing the structure of
                            a sentence through its grammatical derivation (Linz).
                            - A parser is a software component that takes input data, usually text,
                            and builds a hierarchical data structure, giving a structural
                            representation of the input and also checking for correct syntax in 
                            the process (Wikipedia).
